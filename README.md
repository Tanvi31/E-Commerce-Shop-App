A frontend eCommerce application that will consume the backend services. The frontend application is implemented using React and consists of the following pages:

1. Products Page - This page should display all available products for purchase in either a paginated manner or in an infinite-scroll. Users should be able to filter the products based on various criteria, such as category, price range, etc. Users should also be able to add products to their cart.

2. Checkout Page - This page should display the items in the user's cart and allow them to finalize their order. Users should be able to modify their cart before submitting their order. Checkout forms should have proper form validation.

3. Orders Page - This page should display a list of all orders placed by the user. Users should be able to view details of each order, including the items purchased and the order total.
